was able to convert polygon to array by first reading the shapefile into a geodata frame,
selecting a neighborhood using .loc, then using the boundary method on the result... and saving that to a shape file
 The boundary shape file was the input to the make array code.
 
 Did a dissolve on hoods in process_pgh_data and made a boundary file from the
 south oakland hood... but the get array code only gave one set of points
 
 had to stop working cause air issues
