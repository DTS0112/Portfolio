#Example: Start a new repository and publish it to GitHub
#First, you will need to create a new repository on GitHub. You can learn how to create a new repository in our Hello World guide. Do not initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore or License. This empty repository will await your code.

# create a new directory, and initialize it with git-specific functions
git init my-repo

# change into the `my-repo` directory
cd my-repo

# create the first file in the project
touch README.md

# git isn't aware of the file, stage it
git add README.md

# take a snapshot of the staging area
git commit -m "add README to initial commit"

# provide the path for the repository you created on github
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git

# push changes to github
git push --set-upstream origin main
