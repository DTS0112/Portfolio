# Javascript
After ECMAScript 6 came out I spent a few months reaquinting myself with the changes to JavaScript. I began reading [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) by Marijn Haverbeke. This book is excellent and very hard. At the time (early 2017) the third edition was still in development and I felt like I was on the cutting edge. To get a different perspective (and immediate gratification), I also started reading some of the Mozilla Developers Network (MDN) [JavaScript documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and by developing one of the cool [ball games](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_building_practice) which I plan to revisit for this portfolio.
